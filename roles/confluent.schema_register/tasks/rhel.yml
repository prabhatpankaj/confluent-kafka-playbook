- name: Configure the Schema Registry
  template:
      dest: /etc/schema-registry/schema-registry.properties # required. Location to render the template to on the remote machine.
      src: schema-registry.properties.j2 # required. Path of a Jinja2 formatted template on the Ansible controller. This can be a relative or absolute path.
      owner: "{{kafka_user}}" # not required. Name of the user that should own the file/directory, as would be fed to I(chown).
      group: "{{kafka_group}}" # not required. Name of the group that should own the file/directory, as would be fed to I(chown).
      mode: 0640 # not required. Mode the file or directory should be. For those used to I(/usr/bin/chmod) remember that modes are actually octal numbers.  You must either add a leading zero so that Ansible's YAML parser knows it is an octal number (like C(0644) or C(01777)) or quote it (like C('644') or C('1777')) so Ansible receives a string and can do its own conversion from string into number.  Giving Ansible a number without following one of these rules will end up with a decimal number which will have unexpected results.  As of version 1.8, the mode may be specified as a symbolic mode (for example, C(u+rwx) or C(u=rw,g=r,o=r)).  As of version 2.6, the mode may also be the special string C(preserve).  C(preserve) means that the file will be given the same permissions as the source file.

- name: Start the Schema Registry Service
  systemd:
      name: "{{schema_registry_service_name}}" # not required. Name of the service. When using in a chroot environment you always need to specify the full name i.e. (crond.service).
      enabled: true # not required. Whether the service should start on boot. B(At least one of state and enabled are required.)
      state: started # not required. choices: reloaded;restarted;started;stopped. C(started)/C(stopped) are idempotent actions that will not run commands unless necessary. C(restarted) will always bounce the service. C(reloaded) will always reload.
